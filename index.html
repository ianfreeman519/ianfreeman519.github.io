        <h2>About My Research Journey</h2>
        <p>
            At Illinois State University, I studied physics and math. 
            I was always interested in computational modeling, which led me to pursue research with Dr. Matt Caplan on modeling white dwarf stellar interiors.
            Fascinated by plasma physics, I have continued my research in physics simulations with Dr. Brian O'Shea as a PhD student in Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering at Michigan State University.
            I now model high energy density environments using a variation of the astrophysical magneto hydrodynamical fluid solver Athena.
            I am largely interested in fusion energy applications, which has led me to an interest in multi-scale modeling (how to connect the physics of small things to the large-scale behavior of systems).
